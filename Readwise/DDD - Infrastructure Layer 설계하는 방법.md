- Summary: The article discusses how to design the Infrastructure Layer in Domain-Driven Development (DDD) while properly applying the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP). It emphasizes that high-level modules should depend on low-level modules through interfaces to facilitate testing and flexibility. Additionally, it notes that the Infrastructure Layer supports other layers without affecting their definitions, allowing for easier implementation changes.
